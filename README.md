## This bot is not currently functional! A rebuilt/heavily updated bot is coming soon in another repo
Presently I am working on expanding and enhancing the indicators so their values can serve as data points to use for feature engineering a financial data set. 

Additional modifications planned include upgrading completely to Python 3 (and no more urllib2!), switching completely from the bastardized Poloniex API wrapper I was using to the one on PyPI, getting set up on other exchanges in addition to Poloniex.
  
The last profitable action I performed involved a position that I manually opened and had `hodler.py` close out at a modest profit. Although I used this successfully a number of times during the last stint where I was more actively trading, I doubt even this code will work in its current state. 


## TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK

I am not responsible for any money you may lose. If you contact me bitching and complaining about it, I will chew you out and tell you what an idiot you are for not doing your own due dilligence (or consulting a professional), and possibly publicly shame you
