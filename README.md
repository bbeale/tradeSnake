## Update 10-18-2019
> Hello Poloniex Customer,

>We are writing to inform you that Poloniex is spinning out from Circle into a new company called Polo Digital Assets, Ltd. This new company will have the full backing of a major Asian investment group, who intends to focus on the needs of global crypto traders.

>Unfortunately, the Poloniex spin out will not include US customers, so Circle is winding down access to the Poloniex exchange for you and other US customers. Here is the wind down schedule:

>October 18, 2019, US persons will no longer be able to create, or complete the set-up, of a new Poloniex account.

>November 1, 2019, you will no longer be able to execute trades and should no longer deposit assets.

>You will be able to access and withdraw your cryptocurrencies, through Circle until at least December 15, 2019.

>The full announcement can be found here and our Customer Support Team is available to answer any questions you may have. Simply reply to this message and we will get back to you.

>Team Poloniex

So that seals it, this project is officially dead now. Bringing it back seems pointless because the project I have been working on that will replace this one is much better. I will try and remember to link back to it.

## This bot is not currently functional! A rebuilt/heavily updated bot is coming soon in another repo
Presently I am working on expanding and enhancing the indicators so their values can serve as data points to use for feature engineering a financial data set. 

Additional modifications planned include upgrading completely to Python 3 (and no more urllib2!), switching completely from the bastardized Poloniex API wrapper I was using to the one on PyPI, getting set up on other exchanges in addition to Poloniex.
  
The last profitable action I performed involved a position that I manually opened and had `hodler.py` close out at a modest profit. Although I used this successfully a number of times during the last stint where I was more actively trading, I doubt even this code will work in its current state. 


## TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK

I am not responsible for any money you may lose. If you contact me bitching and complaining about it, I will chew you out and tell you what an idiot you are for not doing your own due dilligence (or consulting a professional), and possibly publicly shame you
